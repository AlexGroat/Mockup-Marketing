## Description

The motivation behind this project is to consolidate and organise both the HTML and CSS into reader friendly and understandable code. It was built in order to fix bugs with the webpage, to organise HTML code with the proper semantic elements and properly comment on the CSS file. 

Whilst undertaking this project, I learnt how to properly format a HTML file to suit semantic structure and make it easily readable, including various tags such as article and aside to make it clear what section of the webpage the code is referring to. Ive also learnt how to consolidate and organise the CSS to group together similar elements into on tag or class so that it is easy to interpet and understand the structure of the webpage. Another rule I have learnt is how to format a HTML with the proper indentation so it is easy on the eye and simple to understand.
